    <pr>If you we ever attended a CORPORATE EVENT, then you know the welcome speech gets all of the attention. The welcome speech is what allures the attendees to either listen and take interestâ€¦ or not want to participate at all. Given that, welcome speeches are really important and should be long enough to address everyone properly but short enough to not bore everyone in the room</pr>

<pr>Different circumstances often dictate our style on so many levels. Many women are afraid to try something new at work because they think that that they will not be taken seriously. This era of ripped jeans and T-shirts,spilled paintâ€œ patterns and random zippers, is the best time to start getting a little bit bolder and trying out some new stuff.</pr>
